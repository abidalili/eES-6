          The web storage API provides mechanisms for the client’s browser to
          securely store and easily access key-value pairs. This is useful for
          storing simple data such as usernames or emails, as well as checking
          whether a user can access a particular resource by storing data such
          as access and refresh tokens. We can easily view stored data on the
          client’s browser using JavaScript client-side code running in that
          browser, so if a user leaves the site and later returns, your JS code
          can read from window.localStorage to retrieve any data saved in it. In
          this article, we’ll look at how to stringify and parse JavaScript
          objects into JSON strings so that they can be saved in localStorage.
          We’ll also learn the differences between localStorage, sessionStorage,
          and cookies, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of using cookies
          instead of localStorage.

          when the user selects the dark theme, we save this selection and store
          it within the browser (using the Local Storage); when the page is
          loaded, we check to see if a theme selection was previously made and
          update the website interface accordingly.Local storage is a form of
          web storage that stores data for a long time. This could be a day, a
          week, or even a year. This depends upon the developer’s preference. It
          is important to note that local storage only stores strings so, if you
          wish to store objects, lists, or arrays, you must convert them into a
          string using JSON.stringify().
